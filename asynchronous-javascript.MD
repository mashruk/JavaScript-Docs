# Asynchronous JavaScript

## HTTP Requests from JavaScript

> HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol

> Request - What do we want to do? 
- The request we make for what we hope to do

> Response - Response contains information about what was actually done

HTTP Protocol is always being used behind the scenes
- For example, when you go to the browser and type something in the URL, that initiates an HTTP Request
- When we load some script via the `<script>` tag, that also initiates an HTTP Request

Go to Inspect Element > Network
